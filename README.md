# Displaying-Lithology-Data

### Project Overview
The project involved creating well plots using Matplotlib by extracting and processing well log data.This project makes it easy to visualize important well log data—like Gamma Ray, Density, Sonic, and Neutron—together, letting you choose any depth range you want. By automating plot creation and using clear visuals, it helps you quickly and accurately interpret geological formations, making reservoir analysis faster and supporting better decisions..

### Data Sources
WellData : It includes well log data of depth, gamma ray, sonic log, density log and neutron porosity.

### Tools
Numpy, Pandas & Matplotlib
